## Description
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive, data-driven career guidance tool for IT students that connects real-world job market demands with academic coursework at GGC. By analyzing skill requirements from current job postings and mapping them to courses offered across IT-related majors, the tool aims to help students make informed decisions about their career paths, skill development, and course selection. The long-term goal is to provide an interactive, continuously updated platform that reflects evolving industry needs and clearly demonstrates how academic programs align with entry-level IT roles.

### The Spring 2025 Scope and Progress
During Spring 2025, the project focused on expanding the functionality and data depth of the existing website. Key areas of work included planning for a continuous influx of live job posting data, enhancing data collection and cleaning methods, and broadening coverage to include the full range of IT courses across different domains. The team also explored incorporating job data from additional popular job sites beyond the initial sources to improve accuracy and representation of market trends.

To better align coursework with industry expectations, a faculty survey was designed to collect information on the specific technical and soft skills taught in each IT course, with distribution support from IT faculty leadership. Additionally, efforts were made to improve the website’s user experience by adding more interactive visual elements. Although integration of Power BI dashboards was limited due to platform paywalls, alternative approaches to visualization were considered. Work also began on improving the chatbot algorithm to more accurately match job skills with relevant courses.

### Project Timeline Overview 
- Spring 2021: Initial proof of concept, data collection from job listings, data cleaning, validation of the methodology, and statistical analysis of job skills.

- Spring 2025: Expansion of the website tool, incorporation of additional job data sources, development of faculty surveys, exploration of interactive visualizations, and refinement of skill-to-course matching logic.

- Spring 2026: Focus on updated data collection, analysis, and validation to ensure relevance to current job market trends. 

### Spring 2026 Scope and Team Responsibilities 
In Spring 2026, the team will focus on gathering recent survey data and updated skill-based information from job posting platforms such as Indeed, LinkedIn, and similar sources. The analysis will specifically target IT majors including Software Development, Digital Media, Systems and Security, Enterprise Systems, and Artificial Intelligence. The team will be responsible for cleaning, analyzing, and synthesizing this data to identify the most in-demand technical and soft skills for each major.

Additionally, the team will help refine the mapping between job-required skills and GGC courses, ensuring the tool reflects current curriculum offerings and industry expectations. This phase will strengthen the accuracy and usefulness of the platform, laying the groundwork for future development and long-term sustainability as a practical career-planning resource for IT students.
